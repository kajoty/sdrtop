//! The fourth feed: raw blocks to the IQ recorder, while one runs.
//!
//! The FFT, demod and NET feeds each drop a block they cannot take, and this
//! one does too, for the same reason: the USB callback must never wait for a
//! disk. What it does differently is **say so in-band**. A refused block still
//! goes down the channel, as a few integers without its bytes, so the writer
//! knows to the sample where the file has a hole and why, rather than inferring
//! it from two positions afterwards.
//!
//! The budget is in bytes, not blocks, because a block is 16 kB on one backend
//! and 256 kB on another: a count that suits one is either a trickle or a
//! gigabyte on the other.

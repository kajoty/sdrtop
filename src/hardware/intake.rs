//! Between the driver's thread and the work: a short queue and one thread.
//!
//! **The driver's thread must never wait for sdrtop.** libhackrf calls back on
//! its USB transfer thread, and a transfer is not handed back to the radio
//! until the callback returns. While it runs, the HackRF's own buffer, a few
//! milliseconds deep at 20 Msps, fills with nowhere to go, and what does not
//! fit is dropped inside the radio. The firmware counts those drops; the host
//! is never told. That is what `process_block` running on the callback thread
//! did, at five to seven milliseconds a block against a block of 6.55: a third
//! of the samples at 20 Msps and one in twenty at 10 went missing, and every
//! position downstream still read as unbroken.
//!
//! So the callback does [`super::process::arrive`], copies the block into a
//! recycled buffer and returns. This thread does
//! [`super::process::digest`]. When it falls behind, the queue refuses a
//! block, and that loss is sdrtop's own: counted, and at a known place in the
//! stream, because the positions were stamped before the queue. A loss that
//! is counted and placed is one every reader downstream can handle; a loss
//! inside the radio was one none of them could see.
//!
//! RTL-SDR and SoapySDR go through here too. Their drivers have deeper
//! buffers, but the rule is the same, and one path for all three is one path
//! to get right.
